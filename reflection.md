### HTML

I was able to complete the exercises this week on my own, but I didn't complete them perfectly. I used the walkthrough videos examples to correct my mistakes. In general, the exercises were a great introduction to HTML, and I was entertained by the thought that I'm on my way to making a website from 1992!
